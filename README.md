INTRODUCTION
Religiously motivated attacks have been a tragic and recurring issue throughout history, impacting societies, cultures, and global stability. This project aims to analyze such attacks from an objective standpoint, delving into the underlying causes, geographical distribution, and possible preventative measures.

DATASET
We have curated a dataset from various reliable sources, including incident reports, news articles, and academic research. The dataset includes information on attack dates, locations, casualties, religious affiliations, and other relevant factors. The dataset is available in the data directory.

Methodology
Our analysis employs a multifaceted methodology:

TOOL USED:
Excel, SQL, PowerBI

Data Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned, standardized, and enriched with additional contextual information.
Temporal and Spatial Analysis: We examine the temporal trends and geographical distribution of religious attacks.
Religious Profiling: Analyzing the religious affiliations of both attackers and victims to identify potential patterns.
Causal Factors: Identifying potential socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors contributing to these attacks.
Impact Assessment: Measuring the societal, economic, and political impact of these attacks.
Analysis
Our analysis seeks to answer key questions, including:

Are there certain periods when religious attacks are more prevalent?
Which regions experience the highest frequency of religiously motivated attacks?
Are there specific religious affiliations that are disproportionately involved?
What are the potential drivers behind these attacks?

KEY FINDINGS
Preliminary findings indicate:

Religious attacks often coincide with periods of social or political unrest.
Certain regions, although not exclusively, are hotspots for these attacks.
While some attacks are carried out by individuals, others are orchestrated by organized groups.
Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in the occurrence of religiously motivated attacks.
